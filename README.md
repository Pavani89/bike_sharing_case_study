> Bike Sharing Case Study
In this case study, BoomBikes aims to identify significant variables that predict demand for shared bikes post-pandemic and understand how well these variables explain bike demand. To achieve this, they should conduct a comprehensive analysis of their dataset using statistical methods such as regression analysis. They need to evaluate factors like weather conditions, economic indicators, and possibly demographic data to uncover which variables most strongly correlate with bike demand. This analysis will help BoomBikes prioritize their resources and strategies effectively to capitalize on future market opportunities and enhance profitability once economic conditions improve.

## General Information
A bike-sharing system allows individuals to rent bikes for short-term use from designated stations. Users typically access bikes through automated systems where payment is made electronically and bikes can be returned to any station within the same network. Bike-sharing services are popular in urban areas as they promote sustainable transportation and reduce traffic congestion. Understanding factors influencing bike demand, such as weather, economic conditions, and demographic trends, is crucial for optimizing service offerings and anticipating customer needs. BoomBikes aims to leverage this understanding to boost revenue and stand out in the competitive bike-sharing market post-pandemic.


## Conclusions
- Temperature: Higher temperatures significantly increase bike demand.
- Seasonal Effects: Winter and Summer show higher demand; focus marketing efforts accordingly.
- Month: September sees peak demand; adjust bike availability and promotions.
- Day of the Week: Saturdays exhibit higher demand; extend service hours if needed.
- Working Days: Weekdays see increased demand; ensure bike availability for commuters.
- Weather Conditions: Mist/cloudy and light snow/rain negatively impact demand; adjust strategies accordingly.
- Windspeed: High winds reduce bike rentals; manage availability and promotions accordingly.
- Holidays: Holidays decrease demand; plan special promotions to attract riders.
